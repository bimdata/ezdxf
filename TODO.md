Planned for v1.1
================

DXF Entities
------------

ACIS copy() method support: ACIS data does not reference any DXF resources and copying
is not expensive, all copies share the same immutable ACIS data. 
This feature allows loading ACIS entities from external references by the `xref` module.

Other
-----

- `xref.attach_pdf(layout, filename, insert, scale=1, rotation=0, dxfattribs=None)`
  a simple interface to add PDF overlays, the management of underlay definitions is 
  done automatically 

- (???)`xref.attach_image(layout, filename, insert, scale=1, rotation=0, dxfattribs=None)`
  a simple interface to add images (JPG/PNG/BMP) overlays, the management of image 
  definitions is done automatically 

Ideas for Future Releases
=========================

Add-ons
-------

- drawing add-on improvements: 
  - (>v1.1) Support for `Layout.dxf.plot_layout_options` in export mode of 
    class `RenderContext`:
    - plot with plot-styles; disable loading of the ctb-table in set_currrent_layout()
    - plot entity lineweights; if disabled which linewidth should be used instead?
    - scale lineweights; scale by what?
    - plot transparencies
    - hide paperspace entities (`DXFGraphic.dxf.paperspace` attribute is `True`)
    
    VIEWPORT borders are not plotted at all by the `drawing` add-on
  
  - (>v1.1) clipping path support for block references
    
- (>v1.1) DWG loader, planned for the future. Cython will be required for the 
  low level stuff, no pure Python implementation.

Render Tools
------------

- (>v1.1) ACAD_TABLE tool to render content as DXF primitives to create the 
  content of the anonymous block `*T...`
- (>v1.1) factory methods to create ACAD_TABLE entities
- (>v1.1) tool to create proxy graphic 

DXF Entities
------------

- (>v1.1) ACAD_TABLE entity load and export support beyond `AcadTableBlockContent`
- (>v1.1) ACAD_TABLE tool to manage content at table and cell basis
- (>v1.1) GEODATA version 1 support, see mpolygon examples and DXF reference R2009
- (>v1.1) FIELD, used by ACAD_TABLE and MTEXT
- (>v1.1) explode HATCH pattern into LINE entities, points are represented by 
  zero-length LINE entities, because the POINT entity has a special meaning.
- (>v1.1) HATCH: shift hatch pattern origin, see discussion #769 
  and examples/entities/hatch_pattern_modify_origin.py
- (>v1.1) extend ACIS support:
  transform() method support: each ACIS entity has a transformation matrix which can 
  be modified, but this is expensive, the ACIS data has to be parsed, the 
  transformation matrix modified and the data recompiled.  
  The transformation feature has to be enabled manually for each DXF document by 
  doc.enable_acis_transfromation() 
- (>v1.1) clipping path support for block references, see XCLIP command and 
  discussion #760

(>1.1) Adding a `transform_matrix` attribute to entities which do not have transformation 
support (yet) like ACIS entities which enables to add support for the `transform()` 
method.  A new method `apply_transform_martix()` has to be called to apply the 
`transform_matrix` to the entity itself before export or it should raise a 
`NotImplementedError` exception.

This could be implemented for:
- ACIS Entities (BODY)
- ACAD_PROXY_ENTITY
- ACAD_TABLE
- OLE2FRAME
- DXFTagStorage, all unknown entities

Selection Module
----------------

(>v1.1) A module to select entities based on their spatial location and shape 
like in CAD applications, but using the bounding box of the entities instead 
their real geometry for simplicity.

Selection methods:
- rectangle selection - entity bbox inside a rectangular window
- rectangle crossing - entity bbox inside or crossing a rectangular window
- circle selection - entity bbox inside a circular window
- circle crossing - entity bbox inside or crossing a circular window
- polygon selection - entity bbox inside a polygonal window
- polygon crossing - entity bbox inside or crossing a polygonal window
- fence selection - entity bboxes crossing an arbitrary polyline
- cluster selection - entity bboxes located near together (k_means, dbscan)
- chain selection - linked bboxes starting at a given point or entity (RTree)

The selection geometry should be an object:
- Rectangle
- Circle
- Polygon
- Fence

The selection result should be an `EntityQuery` container, which already has 
`Set` operations to combine multiple selections:
- union of selections
- subtract selected entities from a previous selection
- intersection of selection

The selection methods should support a bounding box cache as an optional 
parameter to improve the performance for multiple selections for the 
same base entities.

Usage should look like this:

```python
from ezdxf import select
from ezdxf import bbox

...

entities = doc.modelspace()

# optional bounding box cache for faster processing of multiple queries:
bbox_cache = bbox.Cache()

rect = select.Rectangle(x0=0, y0=0, x1=10, y1=10)
circle = select.Circle(x=30, y=30, radius=10)

# union:
selection0 = select.inside(entities, rect, cache=bbox_cache)
selection1 = select.crossing(entities, circle, cache=bbox_cache)
result = selection0 | selection1

# subtraction:
selection = select.inside(entities, rect, cache=bbox_cache)
ignore = select.crossing(selection, circle, cache=bbox_cache)
result = selection - ignore
```

Extended entity geometry for selection:
Ezdxf uses the `disassemble` module for the bounding box calculation, which 
deconstructs DXF entities into path and/or mesh primitives. This data
could be used to select entities not only by their bounding box, but also
by their vertices for mesh primitives and by their control points or flattened 
vertices for path entities. 

EntityGeometry enum:
- BBOX
- CONTROL_POINTS
- VERTICES

This feature would require a different caching strategy, because the bounding 
box cache does not contain the disassembled primitives and reusing an existing 
bounding box cache is not possible.

Issues:
- How to handle 2D/3D selections?
- 2D selections always in top-view mode?
- Using special box- and sphere selections for 3D selection?

DXF Document
------------

- (>v1.1) copy DXF document by serializing and reloading the document in memory 
  or by file-system, this is not efficient but safe.

Increase Minimal Required Python Version

In general `numpy` defines the minimal required Python version.

Python 3.9 in late 2023, after release of Python 3.12

- https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.9.html

  `dict[tuple[int, str], list[str]]` can be used in regular code outside of annotations,
  import of `List`, `Dict` or `Tuple` is not required anymore

Python 3.10 in late 2024, after release of Python 3.13

- https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html
- structural pattern matching?
- typing: union operator `|`, outside of annotations (type aliases)
- dataclasses: `__slots__`
- `itertools.pairwise()` replaces `ezdxf.tools.take2()`
