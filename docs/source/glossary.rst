    ACI
        :ref:`ACI`

    ACIS
        The 3D ACIS Modeler (`ACIS`_) is a geometric modeling kernel developed
        by `Spatial Corp.`_ 速 (formerly `Spatial Technology`) and now part of
        `Dassault Systems`. All ACIS based DXF entities store their geometry as
        :term:`SAT` or :term:`SAB` data. These are not open data formats and
        a license has to be purchased to get access to their SDK, therefore
        `ezdxf` can not provide any support for creating, processing or transforming
        of ACIS based DXF entities.

    bulge
        The :ref:`bulge value` is used to create arc shaped line segments in
        :class:`~ezdxf.entities.Polyline` and :class:`~ezdxf.entities.LWPolyline`
        entities.

    CAD
        Computer-Assisted Drafting or Computer-Aided Design

    CTB
        Color dependent plot style table (:class:`~ezdxf.acadctb.ColorDependentPlotStyles`)

    DWG
        Proprietary file format of `AutoCAD`_ 速. Documentation for this format
        is available from the Open Design Alliance (`ODA`_) at their `Downloads`_
        section. This documentation is created by reverse engineering therefore
        not perfect nor complete.

    DXF
        Drawing eXchange Format is a file format used by `AutoCAD`_ 速 to
        interchange data with other :term:`CAD` applications. `DXF`_ is a
        trademark of `Autodesk`_ 速. See also :ref:`what is dxf`

    raw color
        Raw color value as stored in DWG files, this integer value can
        represent :term:`ACI` values as well as and :term:`true color` values

    reliable CAD application
        CAD applications which create valid DXF documents in the meaning and
        interpretation of `Autodesk`_. See also :ref:`what is dxf`

    SAB
        ACIS file format, data stored as binary data

    SAT
        ACIS file format, data stored as ASCII text

    STB
        Named plot style table (:class:`~ezdxf.acadctb.NamedPlotStyles`)

    true color
        RGB color representation, a combination red, green and blue values to
        define a color.
