.. module:: ezdxf.addons.drawing

Drawing / Export Addon
======================

This add-on provides the functionality to render a DXF document to produce a
rasterized or vector-graphic image which can be saved to a file or viewed
interactively depending on the backend being used.

The module provides two example scripts in the folder ``examples/addons/drawing``
which can be run to save rendered images to files or view an interactive
visualisation.

.. code-block::

    $ ./draw_cad.py --supported_formats
    # will list the file formats supported by the matplotlib backend.
    # Many formats are supported including vector graphics formats
    # such as pdf and svg

    $ ./draw_cad.py <my_file.dxf> --out image.png

    # draw a layout other than the model space
    $ ./draw_cad.py <my_file.dxf> --layout Layout1 --out image.png

    # opens a GUI application to view CAD files
    $ ./cad_viewer.py


Design
------

The implementation of the :mod:`drawing` add-on is divided into a frontend and
multiple backends. The frontend handles the translation of DXF features and
properties into simplified structures, which are then processed by the backends.

MatplotlibBackend
-----------------

.. autoclass:: ezdxf.addons.drawing.matplotlib.MatplotlibBackend(ax, *, adjust_figure=True, font=FontProperties(), use_text_cache=True)

Example for the usage of the :mod:`Matplotlib` backend:

.. code-block:: Python

    import sys
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from ezdxf import recover
    from ezdxf.addons.drawing import RenderContext, Frontend
    from ezdxf.addons.drawing.matplotlib import MatplotlibBackend

    # Safe loading procedure (requires ezdxf v0.14):
    try:
        doc, auditor = recover.readfile('your.dxf')
    except IOError:
        print(f'Not a DXF file or a generic I/O error.')
        sys.exit(1)
    except ezdxf.DXFStructureError:
        print(f'Invalid or corrupted DXF file.')
        sys.exit(2)

    # The auditor.errors attribute stores severe errors,
    # which may raise exceptions when rendering.
    if not auditor.has_errors:
        fig = plt.figure()
        ax = fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])
        ctx = RenderContext(doc)
        out = MatplotlibBackend(ax)
        Frontend(ctx, out).draw_layout(doc.modelspace(), finalize=True)
        fig.savefig('your.png', dpi=300)

Simplified render workflow but with less control:

.. code-block:: Python

    from ezdxf import recover
    from ezdxf.addons.drawing import matplotlib

    # Exception handling left out for compactness:
    doc, auditor = recover.readfile('your.dxf')
    if not auditor.has_errors:
        matplotlib.qsave(doc.modelspace(), 'your.png')

.. autofunction:: ezdxf.addons.drawing.matplotlib.qsave

The :class:`MatplotlibBackend` is used by :ref:`draw_command` command of the
`ezdxf` launcher.

PyQtBackend
-----------

.. autoclass:: ezdxf.addons.drawing.pyqt.PyQtBackend(scene=None, *,extra_lineweight_scaling=2.0, use_text_cache=True)

The :class:`PyQtBackend` is used by :ref:`view_command` command of the
`ezdxf` launcher.

PillowBackend
-------------

.. autoclass:: ezdxf.addons.drawing.pillow.PillowBackend

The :class:`PillowBackend` is used by :ref:`pillow_command` command of the
`ezdxf` launcher.

Configuration
-------------

Additional options for the drawing add-on can be passed by the `config`
argument of the :class:`Frontend` constructor :meth:`__init__()`. Not every
option will be supported by all backends.

.. autoclass:: ezdxf.addons.drawing.config.Configuration()

    .. method:: defaults()

        Returns a frozen :class:`Configuration` object with default values.

    .. method:: with_changes()

        Returns a new frozen :class:`Configuration` object with modified values.

        Usage::

            my_config = Configuration.defaults()
            my_config = my_config.with_changes(lineweight_scaling=2)

LinePolicy
----------

.. autoclass:: ezdxf.addons.drawing.config.LinePolicy

HatchPolicy
-----------

.. autoclass:: ezdxf.addons.drawing.config.HatchPolicy

ProxyGraphicPolicy
------------------

.. autoclass:: ezdxf.addons.drawing.config.ProxyGraphicPolicy

Details
-------

The rendering is performed in two stages. The front-end traverses the DXF document
structure, converting each encountered entity into primitive drawing commands.
These commands are fed to a back-end which implements the interface:
:class:`~ezdxf.addons.drawing.backend.Backend`.

Currently a :class:`PyQtBackend` (QGraphicsScene based) and a
:class:`MatplotlibBackend` are implemented.

Although the resulting images will not be pixel-perfect with AutoCAD (which was
taken as the ground truth when developing this add-on) great care has been taken
to achieve similar behavior in some areas:

- The algorithm for determining color should match AutoCAD. However, the color
  palette is not stored in the dxf file, so the chosen colors may be different
  to what is expected. The :class:`~ezdxf.addons.drawing.properties.RenderContext`
  class supports passing a plot style table (:term:`CTB`-file) as custom color
  palette but uses the same palette as AutoCAD by default.
- Text rendering is quite accurate, text positioning, alignment and word wrapping
  are very faithful. Differences may occur if a different font from what was
  used by the CAD application but even in that case, for supported backends,
  measurements are taken of the font being used to match text as closely as possible.
- Visibility determination (based on which layers are visible) should match AutoCAD

See ``examples/addons/drawing/cad_viewer.py`` for an advanced use of the module.

See ``examples/addons/drawing/draw_cad.py`` for a simple use of the module.

See ``drawing.md`` in the ezdxf repository for additional behaviours documented
during the development of this add-on.

Limitations
-----------

- Rich text formatting is ignored (drawn as plain text)
- If the backend does not match the font then the exact text placement and
  wrapping may appear slightly different
- MULTILEADER renders only proxy graphic if available
- relative size of POINT entities cannot be replicated exactly
- only basic support for:

  - infinite lines (rendered as lines with a finite length)
  - VIEWPORT and OLE2FRAME entities (rendered as rectangles)
  - 3D entities are projected into the xy-plane and 3D text is not supported
  - vertical text (will render as horizontal text)
  - multiple columns of text (placement of additional columns may be incorrect)
